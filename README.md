# Zicht CMS

## Deprecated
This package is deprecated in favor of administering the bundles in composer.json yourself. Preferably use our CookieCutter (https://github.com/zicht/cookiecutter-symfony-cms) to kickstart a new project.

This metapackage is created to keep all dependencies for a CMS in a 
controlled package. The versioning and updating grants stability 
The packages installed through this package should act stable.

## Installation
See the [`zicht/cms-tutorial`](https://github.com/zicht/cms-tutorial) for documentation on how 
to install the zicht/cms packages and for more documentation and examples.
