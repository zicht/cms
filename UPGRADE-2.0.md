# Upgrade to 2.0

## zicht/tinymce-bundle
The `zicht/tinymce-bundle` provides a very basic versioning management to allow updating the Tinymce-javascript plugin. This bundle replaces `stfalcon/tinymce`. 

With this update, the minimum requirement for the suggested `zicht/moxiemanager-bundle` is now >= 3.0.
